GovFeeds — Federal updates on your phone

A tiny, mobile‑first website that aggregates raw U.S. government feeds (no media layer). Open it on your iPhone, set your state, and tap Refresh.

What it shows (out of the box)

Federal Register latest documents (no key required)

NWS (weather.gov) active alerts for your state

Congress.gov recent bills (optional — paste your API key in Settings; the key is stored only on your device via localStorage)

Why static (GitHub Pages)?

It’s fast, free, and secure — no servers or databases. All logic runs in the browser.
